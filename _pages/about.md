Welcome! 

I am Jieun Ko, a detail-oriented software developer with 3+ years of experience in computer vision and rendering. I received my Masterâ€™s degree in Electrical and Computer Engineering from Sungkyunkwan University in Feb. 2021, specializing in real-time rendering as a member of Computer Graphics Lab under the guidance of Professor Sungkil Lee.

From 2021 to 2022, I gained valuable research experience as a research intern at the Artificial Intelligence and Robotics Institute of KIST, in the field of 3D reconstruction under the supervision of Dr. Junsik Kim.

 I enjoy working on interdisciplinary teams to develop solutions that address practical challenges. Through my work, I aim to contribute to the advancement of intelligent systems that can better perceive and interact with complex environments.

My main research interests lie specializing in AI, computer vision, and 3D graphics with a particular interest in applying these technologies to robotics and autonomous systems and enable them to understand real-world 3D environment.
